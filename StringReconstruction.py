#You now have a method to assemble a genome, since the String Reconstruction Problem reduces to finding an Eulerian path in the de Bruijn graph generated from reads.
#
#CODE CHALLENGE: Solve the String Reconstruction Problem.
#     Input: An integer k followed by a list of k-mers Patterns.
#     Output: A string Text with k-mer composition equal to Patterns. (If multiple answers exist, you may
#     return any one.)

#IMPORTANT: this program assumes that it is possible to create a path from the input and that each node has only one overlapping node
